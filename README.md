## Description

`iforgotpv` is a bash script that allows you to monitor the progress of a running process that's reading from or writing to a file. It's particularly useful when you've started a long-running command and wish you had used \`pv\` (Pipe Viewer) to monitor its progress.

`iforgotpv` is similar to [progress](https://github.com/Xfennec/progress) but is implemented as a bash script instead of C.

## Features

- Displays progress percentage, current position, total size, transfer rate, and estimated time of arrival (ETA)
- Shows start and end times of the monitored process
- Works with any process ID and file descriptor
- Easy to use with minimal setup

## Installation

### Run from net (if you dare)

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mieweb/iforgotpv/main/iforgotpv > iforgotpv
chmod a+x iforgotpv
./iforgotpv
```

### For Debian-based systems (using apt):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iforgotpv
```

### For Red Hat-based systems (using yum):

```bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum install iforgotpv
```

## Usage

```
iforgotpv <pid> [fd] [interval]
```

- `pid`: Process ID of the command you want to monitor
- `fd`: File descriptor (optional, defaults to 1 for stdout)
- `interval`: Update interval in seconds (optional, defaults to 1)

### Examples

1. Monitor a process with PID 1234, updating every second:
   ```
   iforgotpv 1234
   ```

2. Monitor a process with PID 5678, file descriptor 3, updating every 5 seconds:
   ```
   iforgotpv 5678 3 5
   ```

3. List file descriptors for a process:
   ```
   iforgotpv 1234
   ```

## Output

The script displays a single-line, continuously updating progress bar with the following information:

- Percentage complete
- Current position / Total size
- Transfer rate
- Estimated time of arrival (ETA)

It also shows the start time when the script begins and the end time when the monitored process completes.

## Notes

- This script requires root privileges or appropriate permissions to access /proc filesystem information for the target process.
- The script will exit when the monitored process completes or if it encounters an error.
